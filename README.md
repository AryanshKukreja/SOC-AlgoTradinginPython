# ðŸ“ˆ SOC - Algo Trading in Python

Welcome to the **SOC - Algo Trading Project**, built as part of a learning journey into the world of algorithmic trading. This project isn't a polished production-grade repo, but rather a practical exploration of trading logic, backtesting, and financial market behavior.

## ðŸ§  Project Background

As part of this initiative, we:

- Learned the basics of trading, finance, and market behavior.
- Explored concepts like bid-ask spread, inventory skew, fair value.
- Used a **provided backtesting engine** to simulate trades on historical data.
- Implemented **three sample strategies** and evaluated them.

> The goal was to explore trading logic, not build a full production system.

## ðŸ§ª Implemented Strategies

### 1. ðŸ“‰ Mean Reversion + Trend Filter
- SMA-based fair value.
- Avoids trading during high momentum.
- Inventory-based skew for risk control.

### 2. ðŸ“Š Market Making Startegy

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

Below is a sample backtesting dashboard:


In this github repositry it contains my jupyter notebooks for the 3 sample data that I used, in these It has the strategy code as well as the results by performing this strategy on the backtester.
